The system attempts to provide ease of life to the user by decreasing as much as possible the load of manual calculation and by keeping the track of the expenditure. Instead of having a dairy or a log of the expenses on the phones or laptops, this system allows the user to not just keep tab on the expenses but also plan ahead by keeping the past budget in mind. At the instant, there is no such complete solution present easily or a system providing a graphical representation of the analysis done on the expenses which enables a user to keep a track of his daily expenditure easily. To do so a person has to keep a log in a diary or in a computer, also all the calculations needs to be done by the user which may sometimes results in errors leading to losses. Due to lack of a complete tracking system, there is a constant overload to rely on the daily entry of the expenditure and total estimation till the end of the month.This is a computer based application that will allow users to keeps a digital automated diary. Each user will have to log in through the website. After logging into the system, a user can add the expenses and income he did. As soon as the entry is made about the expense, the database is updated and according to the nature of the amount deduction or addition to the total balance of the userâ€™s account is made.
